                    <h2>My philosophy</h2>
                    <p>I like to write code and I would like to write a lot of really cool code for you for a lot of
                        money. But I have found that there a lot of projects that really don't need a lot of cool,
                        expensive code. There are a lot of ways to solve your web dev issues. <strong>I feel that I
                            specialize
                            in understanding your business needs first</strong>. We live in a world where there are a
                        lot of solutions in search of a problem.</p>
                    <p><strong>I also believe in user experience over visual design.</strong> The modern
                        web is primarily a mobile experience where often function precedes form. I believe in
                        prototyping where appropriate.</p>
